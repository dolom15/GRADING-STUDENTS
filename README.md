# GRADING-STUDENTS
Students' grades are adjusted by this program according to specific guidelines: grades below 38 remain unchanged, while grades 38 and above are rounded up to the closest multiple of five if they are within three points of it. Each grade in the list is examined by the gradingStudents function, which then generates a new list with the most recent findings.
